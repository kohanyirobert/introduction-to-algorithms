== Exercises

1.1-1:: _Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull._
+
* Someone handling customer requests would sort them by their priority.
* Calculating the amount of material required to package a "`funny-shaped`" object.

1.1-2:: _Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a real-world setting?_ 
+
Cost -- e.g. money, people, electricity, energy.
A process that produces a "`product`" at a lower cost than other processes do can said to be more efficient.

1.1-3:: _Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations._
+
.Array
* Strengths
** Index-based access.
** Accessing elements by their index in constant time.
** Retains insertion-order.
** Possible to re-order elements.
** Replacing elements is cheap.
* Limitations
** Fixed number of elements.
** Accessing elements if their index isn't know is costly.
** Inserting elements into the array (e.g. shifting) is costly.
** Keeping the elements ordered (re-ordering) is costly.
** Finding an element in an unordered list is costly.

1.1.4:: _How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?_
+
* Relate
** Both problems can be represented with graphs -- they're based on graph theory.
+
* Different
** In the shortest-path problem we need to find a _single path_ between two nodes.
In the traveling-salesman problem we need to find _multiple paths_ between two nodes multiple times.

1.1-5:: _Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "`approximately`" the best is good enough._
+
* While trying to improve an existing compression method the goal is to create an algorithm that compresses correctly (as its predecessor) _and_ that costs less to execute (takes less time, uses less CPU, needs less IO operations). In such a case only the "`best`" solution is enough.
* In a scenario where a company needs to haul an important package from one location to another before a deadline a "`good-enough`" solution is enough. The "`best`" solution would the one that requires the least amount of time and money. It's easy to find solutions, but it's really complicated to decide if a particular solution is "`the`" best. The first solution that satisfies requirements (gets the package from A to B in time and cost less then the available funds) is "`good enough`".
